# Chromosome-Images
4184 normal chromosome images segmented from 91 karyotype images. Background is expanded to 100*220 (width of 100, height of 220).

Including 181 chromosome 9, 181 chromosome 20, 152 chromosome X, 30 chromosome Y and 182 respectively of remaining classes of chromosomes.

Each chromosome is labeled in the file name. 

e.g. In "161923.054.K.chr1.1invert_pad.gif", "161923.054" is the number of the sample, K represents karyotype image, "chr1.1" represents the image is one of the paired chromosome 1 (the other chromosome 1 is numbered as chr1.2).
